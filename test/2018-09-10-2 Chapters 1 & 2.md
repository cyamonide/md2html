__Financial markets:__ channel funds from those who do not have a productive use for them to those that do.  
This promotes greater economic efficiency.

Principal _Lender-Savers_ are Households. Principal _Borrower-Spenders_ are Firms.  
See diagram in notes.

## Flow of funds

__Direct finance__  

Borrowers borrow funds directly from lenders in financial markets using __securities__ (__financial instruments__).  

__Security__ is a claim on the issuer's future income or assets.  
Securities are __assets__ for the person who buys them and __liabilities__ for the individual/firm who sells (issues) them.

## Debt and equity markets

__Debt market <=> Bond market__  
__Equity market <==> Stock market__  

### Bond market - Bonds

* debt security that promises to make payments periodically over time
* is a contract between a borrower (issuer) and lender (owner)
* regular payments until __maturity__ (short-term < 1y, intermediate-term 1-10y, long term >10y)

### Interest rate

* the cost of borrowing or the price paid for the _rental of funds_
* is usually expressed as a percent
* There are many types of interest rates:
	* mortgage, car loan, treasury bill, checking deposit
	* all are not the same; different from each other

### Stock market - Stocks

* represents a share of ownership in a corporation
* no maturity date
* some make dividend payments
* equity holders are __residual claimants__ (disadvantage)
	* if the corporation were to go insolvent, debt holders are paid _before_ equity holders
* gives claim to the corporation's earnings and assets
* value reflects current value and expected future earnings growth

## Primary and secondary financial markets

### Primary market
* IPO
* not well known to public
* i-banks guarantee prices (underwriting)

### Secondary market
* previously issued securities can be bought and sold
* __brokers__ match buyers and sellers
* __dealers__ offer to buy and sell securities

## Money and capital markets

We distinguish markets by security maturity

### Money markets
* only short term debts are traded (maturity <1y)
* instruments:
	* Gov't of Canada Treasury Bills, Certificates of Deposits, Commercial Paper, Repurchase Agreements

### Capital markets
* market for longer-term debt (>1y)
* instruments:
	* Stocks, Mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, Corporate bonds, Gov't bonds, Canada Savings bonds, Prov and Municipal Gov't bonds

Money markets are much more _liquid_ than capital markets

## Indirect Finance

### Financial Intermediation
* indirect financing (institutions such as banks)
* such institutions move funds from people who save to people who have productive investment opportunities

### FI - Depository institutions
* Chartered banks
* Trusts and Mortgage Loan Companies
* Credit Unions
* Caisses Populaires

### FI - Contractual Savings Institutions
* Life insurance
* Property and casual insurance
* Pension/retirement funds

### FI - Investment intermediaries
* finance companies
* mutual funds
* money market mutual funds

### Roles of FI
1. Lowers transaction costs
	- Economies of scale
2. Improves _risk sharing_
	- e.g if a firm goes bankrupt, you do not lose full amount as the loss is spread across many lenders
	- Asset transformation
	- Diversification
3. Helps solve __asymmetric information__ problems
	- __Adverse Selection:__ problem created by assym. info before the transaction occurs
	- __Moral Hazard:__ is the problem created by assym. info after the transaction occurs
		- Borrowers might engage in activities undesirable from a lender's POV
	- Financial intermediaries can screen and monitor borrowers
